Use the following links to install R and RStudio by following the links below. I highly recommend that you also install Git (link below) and create an account on GitHub (link below). The Git related tools are very useful but 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

urls <- c("https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/",

"https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download",

"https://git-scm.com/downloads",

"https://github.com")

link.df <- data.frame(

Software = c("R", "RStudio", "Git", "GitHub"),

Link = paste0("[", urls, "](", urls, ")")

)

knitr::kable(link.df)

```
