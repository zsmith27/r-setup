    "text": "1.1 What is R?\nR is an open source programming language developed for statistical computing and graphic production. “R can be considered as a different implementation of S”, a language that was developed at Bell Laboratories (https://www.r-project.org/about.html).\n\n1.1.1 Benefits of Using R\n\nReproducibility: Standardized processes (e.g., functions, loops, documentation)\n\n\nWhen using MS Excel processes are often spread across multiple sheets or calculations are performed haphazardly within a single sheet. In general, this makes it very hard to interpret processes performed and to reproduce the process.\n\n\nPower: Ability to perform simple and complex data manipulations, iterative processes, and calculations\n\n\nAccess to more than 10,000 packages on CRAN\nNew packages are constantly being developed\nNew features are constantly being added to existing packages\n\n\n\n1.1.2 R Packages\nR packages are extensions of base R that provide additional features or provide alternative functionality.\n\nAvailability\nCRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/)\nThe Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)\nFTP and web servers that store R Packages\nPackages are required to meet certain standards\nGitHub (https://github.com)\nThese packages are usually under development\nContains development versions of many packages available on CRAN\nCustom (http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)\nYou have the ability to create your own packages."

The desktop version of RStudio is maintained by the company Posit and is free to download.\nAnother popular IDE is Visual Studio Code or VS Code now owned by Microsoft."
